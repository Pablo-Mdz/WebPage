            <h1>More about me</h1>
            <p> I consider myself an outgoing, optimistic and adventurous person. 
                My actually hobbies are traveling, studying programming mainly in python, photography, cycling.
                I studied gastronomy and afterwards I started to travel, 
                I have traveled to 36 countries around the world and I have worked in 5 of them. 
                Since 2017 I've lived in Germany and have worked in gastronomy 
                and in a renewable energy company.
                Parallel to my professional life, I have always been 
                interested in technology and have always tried to keep myself updated.
                Some time ago I realized that I needed to turn my professional career around, 
                that's why I started studying Python as a programming language, Tkinter as a library Flask, HTML, CSS.
                I have more than 10 years of work experience working in various settings
                 and performing various functions, especially in the gastronomic area, 
                 performing organizational tasks, teamwork, task optimization and management, 
                 advice and service in private and public events.
                I am a sociable person, I like to work in a team, 
                I am committed and always willing to learn and improve</p>
