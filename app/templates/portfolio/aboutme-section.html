            <h1>More about me</h1>
            <p> I consider myself an outgoing, optimistic and adventurous person.

                Some time ago I realized that I needed to turn my professional career around, 
                that's why I started studying Python as a programming language, Tkinter as a library) Flask, HTML, CSS.
